**localmem** is the memory layer that follows you across every AI tool you use. **Status:** v0.3.6, rerank + a local cross-encoder on by default; 75% on LongMemEval.

---

## Install

```bash
# One command. Installs the single static Rust core (~66 MB) into
# ~/.local/bin, then runs `localmem setup`: fetches the embedder
# (bge-small) + reranker (ms-marco-MiniLM) models (~210 MB), wires every
# MCP client it detects, and starts the always-on local core on :7788.
curl -fsSL https://localmem.org/install | sh
```

Restart your AI client and ask "do you have memory tools?" — it should mention `memory_write`, `memory_search`, `memory_recall`, and the rest. **That's it.**

Wire an extra client `setup` didn't auto-detect:

```bash
localmem mcp install --client claude          # Claude Desktop
localmem mcp install --client claude-code     # Claude Code CLI
localmem mcp install --client cursor          # Cursor
localmem mcp install --client cline           # Cline (VS Code)
localmem mcp install --client windsurf        # Windsurf
```

**Or via npx** (no Rust binary needed, MCP shim only — useful if a teammate already has the core running):

```bash
npx -y localmem-mcp install --client claude
```

**Have two agents that keep losing context and need re-instruction?** See [docs/SHARED_MEMORY_FOR_AGENTS.md](docs/SHARED_MEMORY_FOR_AGENTS.md) — the 60-second walkthrough that wires multiple agents into one shared memory store.

---

## The 30-second demo

Every other memory product is a database. We're an **event log with caches.**

```bash
# Write a memory
localmem write --kind preference --content "I prefer Rust for systems work"

# Search for it
localmem search "what language do I prefer"
# [1] I prefer Rust for systems work  score=0.412  id=01K...

# Now blow away every derived store
rm -rf ~/.localmem/derived

# Rebuild everything from the event log alone
localmem replay

# Search again — same result, fully recomputed from events.jsonl
localmem search "what language do I prefer"
```

`~/.localmem/events.jsonl` is the **single source of truth**. DuckDB, LanceDB, Tantivy — all recomputable caches. If your DB corrupts, your memory is intact. If this project disappears, your memory still works. If a future version changes the schema, your memory replays clean.

**Nothing else in the category offers this.**

---

## What it does

- **Captures** — `localmem write --kind preference --content "..."` ingests text. The write policy decides commit / dedup / skip / forget and records every decision in `journal.log`.
- **Recall** — `localmem search "query"` runs hybrid BM25 + ANN with per-kind recency decay and reciprocal-rank fusion, reranked by a local cross-encoder (ms-marco-MiniLM, on by default). `--at-time RFC3339` for bitemporal queries ("what did we believe last Tuesday?").
- **Entity profiles** — `localmem recall <subject>` returns a fact-by-fact view of a subject. `localmem profile <subject>` synthesizes it as markdown.
- **Container tags** — every capture can carry `--tags project=X,topic=Y`. Reserved tags include `retention=ephemeral` (auto-expire) and `visibility=private`.
- **Smart forgetting** — active contradiction resolution: a higher-confidence fact on the same `(subject, predicate)` retires the prior live fact and emits an `Update` event, fully auditable via `localmem audit`.
- **Closed-core kinds** — `fact`, `preference`, `decision`, `constraint`, `todo`, `note`. Per-kind recency decay (preferences age slower than todos).
- **Import wizard** — `localmem import-wizard` scans `~/Downloads` for ChatGPT / Claude export ZIPs and migrates them in.
- **MCP server** — 6 tools (`memory_write`, `memory_search`, `memory_recall`, `memory_profile`, `memory_forget`, `memory_journal`), 2 prompts (`session_context`, `summarize_tag`), 4 resources (`localmem://profile`, `localmem://subjects`, `localmem://tags`, `localmem://recent`).

## How it compares

|  | localmem | Local-first peers | Cloud SaaS (Supermemory / mem0 / Zep) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where your data lives | Your machine | Your machine | Their cloud |
| Plaintext leaving your machine | **Never** | Varies (some have on-by-default telemetry) | Always |
| `forget` is auditable | **Event in the log** | App-level delete | "Trust the vendor" |
| Recoverable from a plain-text file | **Yes (`localmem replay`)** | No | No |
| Runtime | **Single static Rust binary** | Node + framework deps | Cloud SaaS |
| MCP tool count | **6** (narrow, auditable) | 25–50+ (wide) | varies |
| License | Apache-2.0 (non-relicensable) | Mostly Apache-2.0 | Mixed |
| If the project dies | **Your memory works** | Your memory works | Your memory is gone |

We are deliberately the narrowest MCP surface in the category. The full power lives in the CLI and is auditable. The agent surface stays minimal.

---

## Works with every MCP-aware agent

| Wired via `localmem mcp install --client <name>` | Generic MCP config |
|---|---|
| Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Codex | Continue, Zed, OpenCode, Aider, custom MCP clients — see [docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md](docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md#9-per-project-memory) for the generic recipe |

After install, restart the AI client. Ask the agent "do you have memory tools?" — it should mention `memory_write`, `memory_search`, `memory_recall`, `memory_profile`, `memory_forget`, `memory_journal`.

---

## Architecture in one paragraph

Append-only JSONL event log is the source of truth. Derived stores (DuckDB for bitemporal facts, LanceDB for vectors via ONNX BGE-small embeddings, Tantivy for BM25) are fully recomputable from the event log. Hybrid retrieval combines vector similarity, BM25 lexical match, and per-kind recency decay via RRF. A write-policy layer decides what to commit, update, dedup, or forget, with every decision recorded in `journal.log`. The Rust core binary owns the engine; the TypeScript MCP server is a thin adapter that exposes 6 tools, 2 prompts, and 4 resources to any MCP-compatible AI tool. CLI and server are peers; both can run without the other. **`localmem replay` rebuilds every derived store from `events.jsonl` deterministically.**

Full design: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Build from source

Prebuilt binaries cover macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) and Linux x86_64. For Intel Mac, Linux aarch64, or anyone who'd rather build it themselves:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VJ-yadav/localmem-community
cd localmem-community/core
cargo build --release           # needs Rust 1.83+; ~5–10 min on first build
./target/release/localmem doctor
```

Intel Mac and Linux aarch64 build cleanly from source today; more prebuilt targets land in a later release.

### Local web dashboard

A read-only visual browser for the memory in your `~/.localmem/`. Coverage overview, your profile, project-scoped search, a timeline, and a typed knowledge graph of every entity localmem has understood — all in your browser, no cloud. Served by the Rust core itself on `:7788`. See [`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md).

## What's free, forever

The core binary, MCP server, event log schema, all importers — all under Apache-2.0. Your data lives in a folder you own (`~/.localmem/` by default). The OSS core never requires a network call to complete a `memory_*` operation. **Zero content telemetry, ever.**

## What's paid (opt-in, future releases)

E2E encrypted sync across devices, cloud compute for heavy multimodal ingestion (audio, video, large PDFs), team contexts, enterprise audit + retention. The relay stores ciphertext only — there is no code path in which plaintext leaves your machine.

The local-first OSS experience is the complete experience. Paid features are always optional.

## License

**This repo (Community Edition) is Apache-2.0 forever.** Every feature
shipped here — the Rust core, the MCP server, the hybrid retriever,
smart forgetting, the dashboard, every importer, every extractor —
stays Apache-2.0. We do not reverse-degrade.

localmem ships as three distinct products:

| Edition | Repo | License | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Community** (you are here) | `localmem-community` | **Apache-2.0** | Feature-complete for individual developers. Free forever. |
| **Enterprise** | `localmem-enterprise` (private) | Closed proprietary, annual contract | Multi-tenancy, SSO, RBAC, audit export, BYOK encryption, SIEM integration, compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA). |
| **Cloud** | `localmem-cloud` (private) | Closed proprietary SaaS | Enterprise Edition + hosting + multi-region + 99.9% SLA + automated backups + mobile app. |

The Community Edition is **complete on its own** for solo developers
and internal-tool teams. The paid tiers exist for organizations that
need multi-user identity, compliance, or managed hosting — they wrap
the Community core, they don't replace it. See [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md)
for the full three-tier model, what's in each edition, and our hard
rules (the load-bearing one: anything that ships Apache-2.0 stays
Apache-2.0 forever).
